It can be found growing to 66 ft (20 m) tall, with exceptional heights around 130-160 ft (40–50 m), with a trunk DBH up to 3 ft 3 in (1 m) thick. The leaves are single on a twig, and flat and needle-like. They are up to 3/4 of an inch (2 cm) in length. They have a glaucous green above with a broad stripe of stomata, and two blue-white stomatal bands below. They are arranged as a whorl on the shoot, but with the leaf bases twisted to be arranged to the sides of and above the shoot, with few or none below the shoot. The cones are 2 1/4- 4 3/4 inches (6–12 cm) long, and dark purple or yellow-brown in color.",

The tree has an angular crown and long, somewhat erratic branches, and is usually deep-rooted and resistant to wind and snow damage. The leaves are unique among seed plants, being fan-shaped with veins radiating out into the leaf blade.",

It is also the tallest known eastern hardwood in North America, known for reaching heights of 191.8 feet (58.49 meters). The Tulip Tree is easy to remember for its leaves, which are shaped roughly like tulip flowers with rounded bases and square-lobed tops. The flowers have a more limited color range then magnolia trees, and are either pale green or yellow (rarely white). Leaves are slightly smaller in the American Tulip Tree when compared to the Asiatic species in this genus - the Chinese Tulip Tree (L. chinense). However there is still considerable overlap between the two species, and they easily hybridize easily. The bark on younger trees starts out as smooth, and dark green in color. As it ages it develops wide, white plates which eventually form into seperate flat ridges.",

The flowers can be seen emerging around mid-July. The buds are smooth and dark brown, and the fruit of the tree is a legume. The bark of the tree is described by some as 'zombie skin' because of its amber color, peeling texture, and green undertones. Amur Maackia is able to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere through a symbiotic relationship with bacteria from the Bradyrhizobium genus. Nodules form on the tree’s roots where the bacteria have penetrated through the root hairs into the main root.",

It forms a dense and asymmetrical crown that starts at a height of  6–10 ft (approx. 2-3 m) and spreads widely in free-standing trees. The crown can be divided into several separate, rounded partial crowns. The young twigs are densely hairy light gray or whitish. Older branches are strong and knotty. The thick, longitudinally cracked cork layers of the gray-brown trunk bark are characteristic of the cork oak. The light and spongy cork fabric shows vertical cracks and is white on the outside and red to red-brown on the inside. Its leathery leaves are alternate and are 1 to 4 (2.5 to 10 cm) long and 1⁄2 to 2+1⁄2 in (1.2 to 6.5 cm) wide.",
