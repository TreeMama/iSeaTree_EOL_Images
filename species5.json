This genus is usually placed in the birch family Betulaceae, although some botanists split the 'Hazels' (along with the 'Hornbeams') into a separate family - Corylaceae. The shrubs reach 3–5 m (9.8 - 16.5 ft) tall, with alternate, double-toothed hazel-like leaves 2–7 cm (.8 - 2.7 in) long. The flowers are produced in spring, with separate male and female catkins. The fruit form in clusters 3–5 cm (1.1 - 2 in) long with 6-10 seeds; each seed is a small nut 4–6 mm (.04 - .2 in) long, fully enclosed in a sheath-like 'involucre' (i.e. a part of the leaf that's found directly below the flower/seed, and encloses the flower/seed with leaf-like petals).",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Junipers are coniferous trees and shrubs in the genus Juniperus of the cypress family Cupressaceae. Depending on the taxonomy, there are between 50 and 67 species of junipers widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Their native climates range from the Artic to tropical Africa. The species in this genus vary in size and shape. Some species are large trees, reaching up to 20–40 metres (66–131 feet) in height. Other species are tightly columnar or low-spreading shrubs with long, trailing branches. Junipers are evergreen with needle-like and/or scale-like leaves. The female seed cones are very distinctive, with fleshy, fruit-like coalescing scales which fuse together to form a berrylike structure.",

The second species is 'Adonidia Dransfieldii' which is native to Borneo and was first described in 2015.

(30 – 40 m) and up to 70 ft. (21 m) wide. An identifying feature of a black walnut tree is its thick, dark gray-black bark that develops deep furrows and thin ridges. Looking at pictures of black walnut bark, you’ll notice a distinct diamond-shaped patterning running up the tree trunk. You can also identify a Black Walnut tree by looking closely at the twigs. When the leaves drop, you will see a distinctive three-lobed scar that looks like a shamrock on the branch. Additionally, there will be few, if any, shrubs or small trees growing near a Black Walnut tree.",

    "DESCRIPTION": "The classic 'Banyan' tree has the scientific name Fiscus benghalensis. This tree is commonly known as the Banyan or the Indian Banyan Fig, and is a tree native to the Indian Subcontinent. Specimens in India are among the largest trees in the world by canopy coverage. It is also known as the 'strangler fig' because it starts out as epiphyte - that is - leaning on another tree that it ends up suffocating. This is accomplished by young plants putting forth roots, which form 'secondary trunks' to support the expansive limbs of the tree. Then these 'secondary trunks' send out more roots until they crowd out (i.e. 'suffocate') the host tree. The leaves of the banyan tree are large, leathery, and used as animal fodder. This tree produces figs which are popular with birds and monkeys, and also produces flowers which attract wasps for pollination. Older trees can reach more than 200 meters (656 feet) in diameter, with a height of 30 meters (98 feet).",

Species in this genus are noted for having fragrant flowers, hard red wood, and conspicuous thorns (although it is worth noting there ARE thornless varieties in this genus). The leaves are pinnately compound on older trees but bipinnately compound on vigorous young trees. The leaflets are .5–1 inches (1.5–2.5 cm) (smaller on bipinnate leaves) and bright green.

Some authorities (i.e. California Native Plant Society) describe this species as being a subspecies of the Southern California Black Walnut (i.e. Juglans Californica). This particular black walnut is endemic to Northern California and likely has only a few native stands remaining around the SF Bay Area. Native stands are commonly found growing along stream beds, and planted stands have been found throughout Northern and Southern California - and occassionally in Southern Oregon. It is currently threatened by hybridization with other walnut trees (including the Juglans Californica), urbanization, and habitat loss due to agriculture. The nuts of this tree have a smooth, brown, thick shell, that contains a small edible nutmeat. Its pinnately compound leaves tend tend to be shorter in length then the Juglans Californica - and unlike the Southern California Walnut - the vein angles bear tufts of hair.",

Due to its small nutmeat, it isn't grown commercially, however this tree is a great choice for wildlife gardens and especially for attracting birds, which eat the nuts and like to nest in the branches. It has large, pinnately compound leaves with 11-19 lance-shaped leaflets with toothed margins and no hair in the vein angles (unlike the Juglans hindsii). Unfortunately, Juglans californica is now endangered in large parts of the southern portion of its natural range due to continued development.",

It is commonly found in the Appalachian region on dry, infertile soils and rocky ridges. It achieves its best growth on rich well-drained soils found near streams. Because of its predominance on steep slopes and dry sites, 'Chestnut oak' has a higher incidence of fire damage and associated decay than other oaks throughout the Appalachians. Notably, it has an inherent resistance to heartwood decay which is greater than that of white, northern red, black, or scarlet oaks. That said, 'Chestnut oak' is still susceptible to most of the diseases that oaks face - including oak wilt (Ceratocystis fagacearum) and the twig-blight fungus (Diplodia longispora). It has glossy, dark greenish-yellow leaves that are 4-6 inches (10-15.24 cm) long turn an orange-yellow to yellowish-brown in the fall. It produces acorns that are a deep-toned brown and are favored by many types of wildlife. The bark of the 'Chestnut oak' is particularly distinctive - it is dark brown to black in color with deep ridges.",

This species of oak is endemic to California, and is commonly found in the Coast Ranges and the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. It is California's most drought-tolerant deciduous oak. The trees grow slowly, about 12 inches (30 cm) per year. Individual trees over 500 years old have been recorded. The blue-green leaves are tough and leathery - and either have smooth margins or are extremely shallowly lobed. As of 2002, it appears that the Quercus douglasii (and many other members of the white oak group) are resistant to the disease known as 'sudden oak death'. Often a blue oak tree will have galls; called “oak apples The oak apples are a greyish-red when growing and greyish-black when dead. Immature wasps, inserted into the tree by their mother, cause them. Another kind of gall grows on the leaves, but these are smaller, usually just a spot on the leaf.",

The genus includes four species of woody twining vines that are native to China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, southern Canada, the Eastern United States, and northern Iran. The flowers come in a variety of colors, including white, lilac, purple, and pink. Flowering is in spring (just before or as the leaves open) in some Asian species, and in mid to late summer in the American species. The trunk of this tree is very 'vine like', comprising of multi-trunked or clumping stems that can be trained to grow together in a single short trunk.",

The Callery pear has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are 1.5-2.7 inches (4-7 cm) long. They are dark green in the summer and are orange or purple in the fall. The 'Bradford Pear' (Pyrus calleryana 'Bradford') is the most common cultivar of the Callery pear species, and sometimes mistakenly referenced as the Callery Pear. However, the cultivar has one distinct difference - the Callery pear trees produce thorns on new branches, while the Bradford pear variety was originally bred to produce no thorns. The Callery pear tree has been widely planted in many urban areas and unfortunately has seeded out into natural areas and is regarded as invasive in many states.",

Although similar in general appearance to the 'Honey locust' (Gleditsia triacanthos), the 'Black locust' lacks that tree's characteristic long branched thorns on the trunk. Instead, the 'Black locust' features pairs of short prickles at the base of each leaf. The leaves of the Black Locust are composed of 7-20 leaflets, which are oval and rounded and slightly pointed at the ends. The leaflets themselves are not that big (1/2-2 inches long). At nighttime, the leaflets fold up and droop. Because of all the leaflets, the Black Locust has a 'feathery' appearance.",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Cocos nucifera is a large palm, growing up to 100 feet (30 metres) tall, with pinnate leaves 13–20 ft (4–6 m) long, and pinnae 2-3 ft (60–90 centimetres) long; old leaves break away cleanly, leaving the trunk smooth. Unlike some other plants, the 'Coconut palm' tree has neither a taproot nor root hairs, but has a fibrous root system. Given proper care and growing conditions 'Coconut palms' produce their first fruit in six to ten years. Overall, they take 15 to 20 years to reach peak production.",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Lodoicea spp. belongs to the Coryphoideae subfamily and the tribe Borasseaea, and its sole species (Lodoicea maldivica) is endemic to the Seychelles islands. Borasseae spp. is the genus closest related to the Lodoicea spp., and this genus has about five species located in Africa, India, South-East Asia, and Madagascar. Species in both genus have fan-shaped leaves, 23-32.8 feet (7–10 m) long and approximately 14.7 feet (4.5 m) wide. They tend to run tall in size - ranging from 82-111 feet (25–34 m) - and both have stems which are heavily ringed with leaf scars. Fruits contain hard, woody endocarps surrounding the seeds (i.e. drupes); and they range in size from date-sized (Latania) to the massive bowling-ball sized fruits of Lodoicea genus. In fact, the sole species in the Lodoicea genus - Lodoicea maldivica (Sea Coconut or Double Coconut) - has the biggest seeds known in the world. The seed of the 'Lodoicea maldivica' has a distinct double-sided shape - and can weigh up to 55 pounds (25kg) and measure up to 1.6 feet (.5 m) long. NOTE: Technically, this should be two seperate genus entries, however, the USFS iTree API does not currently have a complete listing for the 'Sea Coconut or Double Coconut' (Lodoicea spp.) so we combined it with Palmyra Palm (Borassus spp.) for the time being (AUTHOR NOTE DATE: 04/15/2023).",
