Amelanchiers are found to be attractive due to the pure whiteness and abundance of their flowers. Their red, and sometimes yellow, leaves are also very eye-catching. Although individual species in this genus can be easy to identify - the complete and agreed upon taxonomic classification of the Serviceberry (Amelanchier spp.) remains unclear.

The typical dogwood leaf is oval and measures between 3 and 6 inches (7.6 - 15 cm) long, and grows in an opposite arrangement on the stems (although there are Dogwood leaves that grow in an alternate arrangement). The leaves have visible veins that curve parallel to the margins. Dogwood flowers are typically white, but some species produce yellow, pale red or pink blossoms.",

Species in this genus are occasionally planted for erosion control in colder North America regions such as eastern Canada, the upper Midwest, and the northeastern United States. The Ostryopsis species/genus have no common English name, although 'Hazel-Hornbeam' has been suggested (reflecting their similarities to the closely related Hazels spp. and Hornbeams spp.). This genus is usually placed in the birch family Betulaceae, although some botanists split the 'Hazels' (along with the 'Hornbeams') into a separate family - Corylaceae. The shrubs reach 3\u20135 m (9.8 - 16.5 ft) tall, with alternate, double-toothed hazel-like leaves 2\u20137 cm (.8 - 2.7 in) long. The flowers are produced in spring, with separate male and female catkins. The fruit form in clusters 3\u20135 cm (1.1 - 2 in) long with 6-10 seeds; each seed is a small nut 4\u20136 mm (.04 - .2 in) long, fully enclosed in a sheath-like 'involucre' (i.e. a part of the leaf that's found directly below the flower/seed, and encloses the flower/seed with leaf-like petals).",

It is the Manila palm (Adonidia merrillii), which is native to the Philippines and is reportedly naturalized in the West Indies. The second species is 'Adonidia Dransfieldii' which is native to Borneo and was first described in 2015. Some palms sold in retail outlets as 'Adonidia' are in fact 'Alexander Palms' (Ptychosterma Elegans), which are similar but even thinner in form.",

The enormous tree is identified by its irregular oval crown, pinnately compound leaves, dangling catkins, and clusters of edible nuts. Black walnut trees grow between 100 and 130 ft. (30 \u2013 40 m) and up to 70 ft. (21 m) wide. An identifying feature of a black walnut tree is its thick, dark gray-black bark that develops deep furrows and thin ridges. Looking at pictures of black walnut bark, you\u2019ll notice a distinct diamond-shaped patterning running up the tree trunk. You can also identify a Black Walnut tree by looking closely at the twigs. When the leaves drop, you will see a distinctive three-lobed scar that looks like a shamrock on the branch. Additionally, there will be few, if any, shrubs or small trees growing near a Black Walnut tree.",
