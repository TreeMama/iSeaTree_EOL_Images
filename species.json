Mulberries are fast-growing when young, and can grow to 80 ft (24 m) tall. The leaves are alternately arranged, simple, and often lobed and serrated on the margin. The fruit has a collective of clusters and turns from pink to red while ripening, then dark purple or black, and has a sweet flavor when fully ripe.",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Acer nigrum, the black maple, is a species of maple closely related to A. saccharum (Sugar Maple), and treated by some authors as a subspecies of it. Identification can be confusing due to the tendency of the two species to form hybrids. The simplest and most accurate method for distinguishing between the two trees is the generally three-lobed leaves of the black maple versus the generally five-lobed leaves of the sugar maple. The leaves of the black maple also tend to have a drooping appearance. Other differences that are not as pronounced include darker, more deeply grooved bark, slightly smaller seeds, a downy underside, and thicker petioles.",

The leaves are ovate, 2.0-3.5 in (5–9 cm) long and 1.6-3.1 in (4–8 cm) wide, with a rounded base, a pointed tip and a finely serrated margin. The flowers are 0.8–1.8 in (2-4.5 cm) in diameter, with five white to pinkish petals; they are produced singly or in pairs in early spring before the leaves. The fruit is a 'drupe' and similar to a small peach. The single seed is enclosed in a hard, stony shell, often called a 'stone', with a grainy, smooth texture except for three ridges running down one side.",

It forms a dense and asymmetrical crown that starts at a height of  6–10 ft (approx. 2-3 m) and spreads widely in free-standing trees. The crown can be divided into several separate, rounded partial crowns. The young twigs are densely hairy light gray or whitish. Older branches are strong and knotty. The thick, longitudinally cracked cork layers of the gray-brown trunk bark are characteristic of the cork oak. The light and spongy cork fabric shows vertical cracks and is white on the outside and red to red-brown on the inside. Its leathery leaves are alternate and are 1 to 4 (2.5 to 10 cm) long and 1⁄2 to 2+1⁄2 in (1.2 to 6.5 cm) wide.",

The leaves are simple, alternate, usually lanceolate, unlobed, and often with nectaries on the leaf stalk along with stipules. The flowers are usually white to pink, sometimes red, with five petals and five sepals. The fruit is a fleshy drupe (a prune) with a single relatively large, hard-coated seed (a stone).",

Each individual type of acacia usually only has flowers in one specific color. Also, the shape of the leaves is typically unique to each Acacia species. The seeds for this species have various shapes and colors, but are all stored in a similar 'peapod-like' pod sack.",
