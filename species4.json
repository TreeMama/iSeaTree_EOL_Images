The leaves are 1-3 inches (3\u20138 cm) long rounded ovals, green with a waxy glaucous sheen. The autumn colour can be strikingly varied - from peach and yellow to scarlet - and the leaves when crushed can smell like a radish. However, people should take care when touching this plant, this plant is in the same family as poison ivy (Anacardiaceae) and contact with its sap may cause contact dermatitis.",

Each individual type of acacia usually only has flowers in one specific color. Also, the shape of the leaves is typically unique to each Acacia species. The seeds for this species have various shapes and colors, but are all stored in a similar 'peapod-like' pod sack.",

Six of the species (Adansonia grandidieri, A. madagascariensis, A. perrieri, A. rubrostipa, A. suarezensis, and A. za) are endemic to Madagascar. The other two species come from mainland Africa/Arabian penninsula, and northwest Australia. Some of the species (such as the Adansonia suarezensis or Suarez baobab) are becoming increasingly rare due to habitat loss. Previously, the 'Baobab' was classified within the family Bombacaceae - which is a widely distributed family of tropical trees. Currently, they are now placed in the Malvaceae family - which is is a family of flowering plants (with a few trees) - which is estimated to contain around 4,225 known species. The 'Baobab' is frequently known as the 'tree of life' or as the 'upside down tree'. They rank as some of the most long-lived of vascular plants in the world, and have large flowers that are reproductive for a maximum of 15 hours. Trees within this genus are easy to identify due to their unusual barrel-like trunks and sparse - often rounded - crowns. It is also notable that many species in this genus have edible leaves and fruits - and some are important sources of herbal remedies.",

It is native to Latin America and the Caribbean, with one species (Vasey's Wild Lime i.e. Adelia vasey) extending northward into the southernmost part of Texas. Plants of this genus also occur naturally throughout Central and Southern Florida. There are individual species in this shrubby genus that actually grow to be very tall - even upwards to 13.7 ft (4.2 m). Species in the 'Wild lime' genus bloom year-round, with peak flowering occuring in winter and spring. Its dense foliage provides cover, and food, for many birds and small wildlife. Also, this genus of tree is a noted foodplant for many butterflies- including the Giant Swallowtail, one of the largest known butterflies. Despite its common name, 'Wild lime' is merely a cousin of culinary limes and other citrus fruit. However ,it is worth noting that 'Wild lime' flowers and crushed leaves really do smell distinctively like lime. Another notable trait about the species in this genus is that they have trunks and branches armed with sharp hooked thorns.",

The tree grows rapidly, and is capable of reaching heights of 15 m (50 ft) in 25 years. While the species rarely lives more than 50 years, some specimens exceed 100 years of age. The bark is smooth and light grey, and the leaves are large (1 to 3 ft long), odd- or even-pinnately compound on the stem. It is considered one of the worst invasive plant species in Europe and North America.",

It is native to the Central Coast of California and Mexico, and features upward pointing branches and a rounded top. The leaves ('needles') are bright green, in clusters of three (two in var. binata), slender, 8 - 15 cm (3.1 - in) long and with a blunt tip. The cones are 7 - 17 cm (2.8 - 6.7 in) long, brown, ovoid (egg-shaped). The bark is fissured and dark grey to brown. It is adapted to cope with stand-killing fire disturbance. Its cones are serotinous, i.e. they remain closed until opened by the heat of a forest fire; the abundant seeds are then discharged to regenerate on the burned forest floor. The cones may also burst open in hot weather. Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) and Bishop pine (P. muricata) are the tree species most commonly infected by Pitch Canker in California.",

Determining if a tree is a spruce is not difficult; however, specifying which species of Spruce the tree is can be considerably more challenging. In general, trees of this genus can be identified by the four-sided needles and the cones that hang downwards after pollination.",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Arctostaphylos auriculata (Mount Diablo Manzanita) is an endangered species of Arctostaphylos, limited in geography to the area surrounding Mount Diablo, California.  It is a woody shrub that ranges from 3-14 feet (1-4.5 m) tall. It has serpentine, glandless stems covered in white hair. The short 0.5-1.7 inch (1.5-4.5 cm) silvery leaves overlap in a distinctive way.  The species name, 'auriculata', means having two earlike lobes, and specifically references its deeply lobed leaf bases. Its pink to white flowers are small and bell-shaped. The common name 'Manzanita' refers to the berry-like spherical fruit it bears (i.e. the Spanish name for apple is 'manzana').",
