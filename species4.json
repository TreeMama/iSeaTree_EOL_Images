    "DESCRIPTION": "Maple (Acer spp.) contains about 120+ species, most which are native to Asia. Maples can be separated into two groups, the soft maple group and the hard maple group. The best way to identify maple trees is by their leaves, bark, and fruit. Maple trees commonly have leaves with pointed lobes and with deep indentations between the lobes. The bark on maple trees starts smooth and gray before developing fissures and furrows. Maple tree fruit looks like small wing-shaped leaves.",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Adansonia is a genus made up of eight species of medium to large deciduous trees known as 'Baobabs'. Six of the species (Adansonia grandidieri, A. madagascariensis, A. perrieri, A. rubrostipa, A. suarezensis, and A. za) are endemic to Madagascar. The other two species come from mainland Africa/Arabian penninsula, and northwest Australia. Some of the species (such as the Adansonia suarezensis or Suarez baobab) are becoming increasingly rare due to habitat loss. Previously, the 'Baobab' was classified within the family Bombacaceae - which is a widely distributed family of tropical trees. Currently, they are now placed in the Malvaceae family - which is is a family of flowering plants (with a few trees) - which is estimated to contain around 4,225 known species. The 'Baobab' is frequently known as the 'tree of life' or as the 'upside down tree'. They rank as some of the most long-lived of vascular plants in the world, and have large flowers that are reproductive for a maximum of 15 hours. Trees within this genus are easy to identify due to their unusual barrel-like trunks and sparse - often rounded - crowns. It is also notable that many species in this genus have edible leaves and fruits - and some are important sources of herbal remedies.",

It is native to Latin America and the Caribbean, with one species (Vasey's Wild Lime i.e. Adelia vasey) extending northward into the southernmost part of Texas. Plants of this genus also occur naturally throughout Central and Southern Florida. There are individual species in this shrubby genus that actually grow to be very tall - even upwards to 13.7 ft (4.2 m). Species in the 'Wild lime' genus bloom year-round, with peak flowering occuring in winter and spring. Its dense foliage provides cover, and food, for many birds and small wildlife. Also, this genus of tree is a noted foodplant for many butterflies- including the Giant Swallowtail, one of the largest known butterflies. Despite its common name, 'Wild lime' is merely a cousin of culinary limes and other citrus fruit. However ,it is worth noting that 'Wild lime' flowers and crushed leaves really do smell distinctively like lime. Another notable trait about the species in this genus is that they have trunks and branches armed with sharp hooked thorns.",

They resemble a small perennial thorny shrub, with intricate branching patterns, and often have sharp yellow spines that are 1-2 inches (2.54 - 5.08 cm) in length.",

It is native to the Central Coast of California and Mexico, and features upward pointing branches and a rounded top. The leaves ('needles') are bright green, in clusters of three (two in var. binata), slender, 8 - 15 cm (3.1 - in) long and with a blunt tip. The cones are 7 - 17 cm (2.8 - 6.7 in) long, brown, ovoid (egg-shaped). The bark is fissured and dark grey to brown. It is adapted to cope with stand-killing fire disturbance. Its cones are serotinous, i.e. they remain closed until opened by the heat of a forest fire; the abundant seeds are then discharged to regenerate on the burned forest floor. The cones may also burst open in hot weather. Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) and Bishop pine (P. muricata) are the tree species most commonly infected by Pitch Canker in California.",

Determining if a tree is a spruce is not difficult; however, specifying which species of Spruce the tree is can be considerably more challenging. In general, trees of this genus can be identified by the four-sided needles and the cones that hang downwards after pollination.",

Amelanchiers are found to be attractive due to the pure whiteness and abundance of their flowers. Their red, and sometimes yellow, leaves are also very eye-catching. Although individual species in this genus can be easy to identify - the complete and agreed upon taxonomic classification of the Serviceberry (Amelanchier spp.) remains unclear.

    "DESCRIPTION": "Calocedrus is a genus of coniferous trees in the cypress family Cupressaceae. It was first described as a genus in 1873, and is related to the Thuja, and has similar overlapping scale-leaves. Calocedrus differs from Thuja in the scale leaves being whorls of four (actually opposite decussate pairs like Thuja, but NOT as evenly spaced apart as in Thuja). Species in the Calocedrus genus have scales with successive pairs placed closely together, rather than distantly spaced. Also the cones have just 2–3 pairs of moderately thin, erect scales, rather than 4–6 pairs of very thin scales which are featured in the Thuja genus.",
