The leaves are simple, 4 - 6 inches (10.16 - 15.24 cm) long and are evenly and deeply lobed with rounded leaf tips. Leaves are pinnately lobed with 5 to 9 irregular rounded lobes. During the summer the leaves are dark green above and pale beneath. Their fall color ranges from saddle brown to tinted gold; and occasionally dull red.",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Sequoiadendron giganteum (Giant Sequoia) is also known as: Giant Redwood, Sierra Redwood, Sierran Redwood, and Wellingtonia. It has also been called simply 'Big Tree' \u2014 a nickname which was used by the conservationist John Muir. It is the sole living species in the genus Sequoiadendron, and one of three species of coniferous trees known as Redwoods, classified in the family Cupressaceae with the Sequoia Sempervirens (Coast Redwood) and Metasequoia Glyptostroboides (Dawn Redwood). Giant sequoia specimens are some of the most massive trees on Earth, grow 250 to 300 feet (76 - 91.44 m) in the wild. An etymological study published in 2012 concluded that an Austrian writer, Stephen L. Endlicher, originated the genus name. A linguist and botanist, Endlicher corresponded with experts in the Cherokee language including Sequoyah, who was a Native American polymath from the Cherokee Nation, and is also credited as the inventor of the Cherokee syllabary. Endlicher realized that - coincidentally - the genus could be described in Latin as 'sequi' (meaning 'to follow') because the number of seeds per cone in the newly classified genus aligned in mathematical sequence with the other four genera in the suborder. Endlicher thus coined the name 'Sequoia' as both a description of the tree's genus and an honor to the indigenous man he admired. Giant sequoias are among the oldest living organisms on Earth, and are the verified third longest-lived tree species after the Great Basin Bristlecone Pine and Alerce. The oldest known giant sequoia is 3,200\u20133,266 years old based on dendrochronology.",

Its common name is Western Red Cedar, but it is also called Pacific Red Cedar and Western Arborvitae. The latin term 'plicata' means 'folded' and this refers to the folding of the lateral scale leaves around the base of the facial scale leaves - which in some ways resemble origami folds. Another distinguishing feature are the white markings ('butterfly' pattern) that can be occasionally seen on the underside of the leaf spray. Cones are also a good clue, the Western Red Cedar female cones are .31-.39 inches (8-10mm) long and slightly oval in shape with a woody texture. They occur in clusters, and are carried usually upright on the lower branches of the tree. The Western Red Cedar has been called the 'corner stone of northwest coast Indian culture'. Its wood is easily split and rot resistant and was used to make important cultural items including, dugout canoes, paddles, house planks, baskets, spears, arrow shafts, and many other implements. The bark was stripped and dried from in the spring for making baskets, ropes, and mates. Red Cedar was considered an excellent fuel - especially for drying fish - because it burns with little smoke.",
