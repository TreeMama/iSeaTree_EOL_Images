# iSeaTree_EOL_Images
Place to store in-progress downloaded image data and the modified species.json


NOTE:

- need to make a pull request FIRST (to pick up this README and the species.json)
- Create new items in species.json 'thumb_pic', 'full_pic', and 'genus'
- populate the 'thumb_pic' and 'full_pic' with the directory of the initial images from EOL 

CHANGES:

#AS of 6/7/2022, USE THE species.json for loading to firebase (species2,species3,species4 are now out of date)

- As of 6/7/2022, everything has a description (see the DESCRIPTION_log.txt) and a FULL_PIC. 
- treemama notes: all images are sourced to either the '/images/' folder or '/missing_images/' folder
