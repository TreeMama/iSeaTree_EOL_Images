This tree is a large evergreen which grows to mature heights of 165 feet (50+ m) or more. It has a globose, conical crown. Bark is smooth, furrowed only at the base, and can become scaly with age. The Pacific Silver Fir has needles similar to Grand Fir, dark green on top with white lines underneath. But the needles are shorter and point forward and upward rather than lying flat like Grand Fir needles. This gives each twig an appearance similar to hairs growing on a dog's tail.",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Abies grandis is a fir native to the Pacific Northwest and Northern California. It occurrs at altitudes of sea level to 1,800 m. It is also a major constituent of the Grand Fir/Douglas Fir Ecoregion of the Cascade Range. In appearance, it looks very similar to the Pacific Silver Fir (Abies amabilis), except it tends to grow taller (260 ft vs 160 ft) and prefers drier climates. Unlike the Pacific Coast Fir it can also be found further inland from the coast (though it does occur with some frequency near to the coast). To distinguish the two species from each other, compare the bark (Grand Fir is more of a grayish-red brown color, whereas Pacific Fir tends to be more of a silver-grey brown color). Also the needle arrangements are different. The needles on the Grand Fir form flattened parallel sprays that show both the upper and lower surfaces of each twig. Each needle pair lies parallel to each other, and almost directly perpendicular from the branch. The Pacific Silver Fir needles look more bushy. With the Pacific Silver Fir needles point forward and upward - and look very similar to the hairs on a dog's tail.",

It earned its name because it is the largest native fir in North America. In its native habitat it grows 180-270 feet (54.8-82.2 meters) tall. This tall narrow tree features a long, columnar trunk and conical crown with short, nearly horizontal branches. It's easy to identify noble fir by looking at the underside of a twig. The needles are shaped like hockey sticks, and sweep away from the twig uniformly, giving them a combed appearance.",

This tree features distinctive, 3-lobed leaves that are 2â€“4 inches (5-10.16 cm) long and closely resemble a trident. This tree tends to grow as a multi-stemmed, low-branching specimen, but it can be pruned to a single stem. The exfoliating bark reveals an orange-brown inner bark, which adds interest. The fall color can be variable, sometimes yellows but usually reds and oranges.",

On average it falls between 25 ft. to 35 ft. (~7.5 to 10.6 meters) in height and width. Because of its small size it is perfect for hedges and is found often in urban landscapes.",

Identification can be confusing due to the tendency of the two species to form hybrids. The simplest and most accurate method for distinguishing between the two trees is the generally three-lobed leaves of the black maple versus the generally five-lobed leaves of the sugar maple. The leaves of the black maple also tend to have a drooping appearance. Other differences that are not as pronounced include darker, more deeply grooved bark, slightly smaller seeds, a downy underside, and thicker petioles.",

It was introduced to North America in the mid-1700s as a shade tree, and was widely planted as a street tree in the mid-20th century to replace elms destroyed by the Dutch elm disease. It is a large deciduous tree, often over 40 ft (approx. 12 m) at maturity with a broad crown. Leaves have five sharply pointed lobes, and are about 4-7 inches (10-18 cm) in length and width. Of the native maples, Norway maple is most similar in appearance to the Sugar maple. It can be distinguished from the Sugar Maple by the milky white sap that appears at the base of the leaf stems when the leaves are pulled from their branches. Native maple species have clear sap. The winged seeds (samaras) of the Norway maple are also somewhat larger than those of native species.",

In April, prior to the trees leafing out, a series of small yelow-green flowers develop. When the leaves appear they have 5 to 7 lobes that unfurl in the spring with a brown-red tinge. As the leaves mature they become a deep green color which turns into yellow in the fall.",

Simple leaves are also occasionally present; technically, these are single-leaflet compound leaves. It features yellow-green flowers that are small and appear in early spring. In the fall, leaves are typically yellow with red stalks. The boxelder maple has lumber that is distinctly lighter then other maples, and its brown bark trunk (particularly when wet) gives off a foul, and unusual smell.",

Arbutus unedo is also commonly used in landscaping in California, where the Pacific Madrone is harder to cultivate. Arbutus unedo prefers cliff edges if it can get them.

It should be noted that the Incense cedar is NOT a true cedar (i.e. genus Cedrus), and is actually a member of the cypress family (Cupressaceae). The foliage in this tree is flattened sprays with scale-like leaves 0.08 to 0.6 inches (2â€“15 millimeters) long.  They are arranged in opposing decussate pairs, with the successive pairs closely then distantly spaced, so forming apparent whorls of four; the facial pairs are flat, with the lateral pairs folded over their bases. Before opening, the small hanging female cones have ends that are tapered into a hook-shape. This tree is the preferred host of a Wood Wasp, Syntexis libocedrii a living fossil species which lays its eggs in the smoldering wood immediately after a forest fire. The tree is also host to Incense-Cedar Mistletoe (Phoradendron libocedri), a parasitic plant which can often be found hanging from its branches.",

Even though it is sometimes referred to as the 'Yellow Cedar' - it is neither yellow or a cedar. In its native habitat, this tree is most likely to be confused with Thuja plicata (Western Red Cedar). However, the mature trees are easily distinguished by their bark - the Western Red Cedar has more of a red-grey bark, while the Yellow Cedar is mostly white-grey. The female cones are also distinctly different- with the Western Red Cedar having a more open oval shape and the Yellow Cedar having a more tightly round - globose - shape with a hooked end.",
